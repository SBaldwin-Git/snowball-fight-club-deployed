# Snowball Fight Club

## Overview

Snowball Fight Club is a festive app designed to bring people together through snowball fights, adding a playful touch to social interactions during the holiday season.

### Inspiration

The challenge was to create an app fostering social engagement with a Christmas theme. We aimed to make it enjoyable while pushing our boundaries with new tools.

### Features

- **Geolocation-Based Map:** Users grant permission, and the app displays a local map with a Christmas tree marker indicating their location.

- **Snowball Fight Markers:** Explore and create snowball fights marked on the map, each with details such as description, time, and date.

## How It Works

Once the website has the user's permission to access their location information and confirms not to talk about snowball fight club (We had to add this) they are shown a local map of their area.

A Christmas tree marker indicates their location and marked on the map are snowball fight markers. Each marker has its own description, time, and date. The local snowball fights are also displayed in a sidebar menu that the user can click on to zoom into that location on their map.

## Tech Stack

We spent a great deal of time at the start of the day discussing the tech stack and tools that we could use to best achieve Snowball Fight Club whilst getting a little out of our comfort zone.

We, in the end, settled on a core tech-stack utilizing React in TypeScript. We made use of the React-Leaflet library to help us implement the geolocation functionality in our app. Styling for the web app was assisted by the use of MaterialUI.

We also made use of other tools that were new to us that our mentor Ryan recommended. These included using Replit as our IDE due to its online and real-time functionality so we could all work on the same project at the same time with much more ease during the hackathon. Smaller tools like Super Plate were also used to create the app's initial boilerplate shell.
